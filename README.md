### Things to improve upon and to look into
    1. On my score board page I was unable to organize the scores from highest to lowest. Instead it seemed to organized them alphabetical.
    2. Review and attempt again since many new concepts such as render, JSON, and window.location were the first time I had implimented them in a code.
